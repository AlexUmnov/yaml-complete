1. Evalution code [DONE]
2. Data cleanup [DONE]
3. Opensource model(s) [DONE]
4. Finetune something [DONE]


Potential improvements:

- Play with the prompt for chat models
- Try other infilling models 
- Try encoder-decoder architectures
- For opensource models try to generate only tokens, which result in valid YAML
- Get more data, better quality (i.e. don't autocomplete user, tokens, etc...)
- Quantize the model with cpu-friendly benchmark for smoother cpu experience
- Finetune a larger model, test it, distil it into a smaller one
